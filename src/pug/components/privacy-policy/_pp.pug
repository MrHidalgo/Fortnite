You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement."
            p!= "<span>8.10</span> To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal."
